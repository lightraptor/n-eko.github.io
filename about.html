  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>This is a basic introduction to HTML.</p>
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create web pages and documents.</p>
  <p>HTML consists of tags and attributes that define the structure and content of a web page.</p>
  <p>Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and usually come in pairs. For example, <p> and </p> are tags that mark the beginning and end of a paragraph.</p>
  <p>Attributes are additional information that modify the behavior or appearance of a tag. They are written inside the opening tag, after the tag name. For example, <p align="center"> is a tag with an attribute that aligns the paragraph to the center.</p>
